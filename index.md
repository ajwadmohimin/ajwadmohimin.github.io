Hi! \\I am **Md Ajwad Mohimin**, a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate. My passion lies in **Computational Fluid Dynamics** (CFD) and its applications in understanding complex fluid systems, including the flows within the human body, such as **cardiovascular and cerebrovascular flows**.\\
My undergraduate research works involved flow simulation to understand the hemodynamics inside a patient-specific aneurysm sac. At present, I am working on blood flow simulation in aneurysm under different medical conditions and its treatment option (i.e., flow diverting stents). 

In addition to hemodynamic simulations, I had been involved in projects related to aerodynamics, heat transfer, and turbulent flow. I have practical knowledge of CFD and CAD and proven proficiency in *OpenFOAM, Solidworks, Python, and C++*.
I also feel enthusiastic about integrating **Machine Learning** into CFD to make flow simulation faster and cheaper. \\

My goal is to improve the understanding of physical flow phenomena (including mechanobiology within the human body) using CFD, and I want to continue my journey in research and academia being a supporter of open science and open knowledge.
