## Hemodynamics in Cerebral Aneurysms
Cerebral Aneurysm is an abnormal bulge in the wall of arteries in the brain.
It usually occurs when the layers of the arterial wall get weakened and loss their
integrity. Ruptured aneurysms are crucial because they result in subarachnoid hemorrhage which can be life threatening. Behind the formation, growth and rupture of an anuerysm, hemodynamics play a key role. Thus, hemodynamic factors such as- Wall Shear Stress, Oscillatory Shear Index, Relative Residence Time, etc. anticipate to predict the status of an aneurysm.\\
This work uses open-source CFD toolbox *OpenFOAM* paired with patient-specific geometry and pulsatile flow rate to study the hemodynamics in aneurysm sac. Then, visualization and the extraction of hemodynamic factors were performed using python script in *Paraview*.
