## Hemodynamics in Cerebral Aneurysms
Cerebral Aneurysm is an abnormal bludge in the wall of arteries in the brain.
It usually happens when the layers of the arterial wall get weakened and loss their
integrity. Ruptured aneurysms are crucial because they can cause subarachnoid hemorrhage which can be life threatning. Behind the formation, growth and rupture of an anuerysm, hemodynamics play a vital role. Thus, hemodynamic factors such as- Wall Shear Stress, Oscillatory Shear Index, Relative Residence Time, etc. anticipate to predict the status of an aneurysm.\\
This work uses open-source CFD toolbox *OpenFOAM* paired with patient-specific geometry and pulsatile flow rate to study the hemodynamics in aneurysm sac. Then, visualization and the extraction of hemodynamic factors were done using python script in *Paraview*.
